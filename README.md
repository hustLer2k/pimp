### Technologies Used

Pimp is built using the following technologies:

-   Next.js: A React framework for server-side rendering and building web applications.
-   Supabase: A cloud-based platform for building and running mobile and web applications, utilizing PostgreSQL and other open source technologies.
-   TailwindCSS: A popular utility-first CSS framework that helps developers create custom, responsive designs quickly and efficiently. Unlike traditional CSS frameworks that come with pre-designed components and styles, Tailwind provides a set of pre-defined classes that can be used to style HTML elements directly. This allows developers to rapidly prototype and customize their designs with minimal CSS code, resulting in faster development times and more consistent designs. Tailwind also includes many helpful features, such as responsive design utilities, dark mode support, and extensive customization options.
